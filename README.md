First of all I have been looking into gRPC s, since it is my first time working with them. I did some sample solutions where I tested the implementations and tried to understand the general structure. Then I started building the gRPC ser ver from the project types available in Visual Studio. During this process I followed the approach of the tutorials and guides that I found on the internet. Then I implemented a Console application which acts as the gRPC Client. I was looking for ways to access the gRPC client from a web application. I also tought about implementing a middle database layer where the gRPCC client would weed the database and the web app would access the database for the data. Then I came across an implementation where the client was directly implemented within the web app and decided to follow that route. I left the gRPC client with in the solution but there is no need for it. When you start the application it will directly open the page where the result will be shown. I didnt apply any other logic to the front end.
