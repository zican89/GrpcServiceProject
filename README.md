First of all I have been looking into gRPC s, since it is my first time working with them. I did some sample solutions where I tested the implementations and tried to understand the general structure. Then I started building the gRPC ser ver from the project types available in Visual Studio. During this process I followed the approach of the tutorials and guides that I found on the internet. Then I implemented a Console application which acts as the gRPC Client. I was looking for ways to access the gRPC client from a web application. I also tought about implementing a middle database layer where the gRPCC client would weed the database and the web app would access the database for the data. Then I came across an implementation where the client was directly implemented within the web app and decided to follow that route.
